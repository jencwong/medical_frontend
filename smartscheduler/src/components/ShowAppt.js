//This code is incomplete. We need to decide what we want the user to see. Recommendations: The show page is the complete record / details of what is shown on mouseover. It should contain all of the details of the appointment. 
//Additional features could include: options to print, show map of location with option of entering starting point, add to personal calendar (cal api link on how to do this was Slacked). Questions for consideration: should edit and delete be options too? View for patient and doctor should be different - for example, the doctor does not need a map.
